## How to run
- Clone and install frontend code with npm i and start with npm start
- Clone the backend code (will add it soon) - Backend is needed to bypass CORS rules from the various APIs being used and prevent the browser from letting us read the responses
- (Optionally) Capture curl requests from all the mentioned websites for their search endpoints and replace it in code to match your location and other things
- 
## Roadmap
- [ ] Make the location dynamic
- [ ] Add more lesser used grocery platforms to the comparison
- [ ] Find a better way to match same products from all APIs
- [ ] Be able to set a price tracker with alerting
- [ ] Compare delivery prices and other offers
- [ ] Making it a chrome extension potentially to check cart prices dynamically
